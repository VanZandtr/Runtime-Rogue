CONTEXT SUMMARY - Code Roguelite Game Development - 2024-05-22

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
- Web-based roguelite coding game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Players use code blocks to reach target values
- Features class system, life mechanics, and floor progression

GAME MECHANICS:
1. Core Gameplay:
   - Build programs using code blocks (GOTO, ADD, DICE, etc.)
   - Execute programs to reach a target value
   - Limited to one instance of each block type

2. Class System:
   - Hacker: Program flow control (GOTO, IF, LOOP), faster execution
   - Mathematician: Numerical operations (ADD, MULTIPLY, DIVIDE), higher starting goal
   - Gambler: Chance-based blocks (DICE, FLIP, RANDOM), extra starting life

3. Roguelite Elements:
   - Life system (lose lives when failing to reach goals)
   - Floor progression (complete multiple rounds to advance)
   - Permanent death when out of lives
   - Score tracking across runs

4. Reward System:
   - New code blocks
   - Extra blocks
   - Health restoration
   - Max health increases

FILE STRUCTURE:
- index.html: Main game interface
- styles.css: Visual styling
- game.js: Game logic and mechanics

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
- ADD block adds two values together
- Each code block limited to one instance per program
- Class selection at game start
- Lives displayed as hearts
- Floor progress shown with progress bar
- Game over screen with final score and restart option

FUTURE ENHANCEMENT IDEAS:
- More block types
- Special events between floors
- Boss battles requiring specific code solutions
- Persistent upgrades between runs
- Achievement system
