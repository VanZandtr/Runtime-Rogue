# Code Roguelite Development Context

## Current Session - 2024-05-22

### Project Overview
- Web-based roguelike coding game inspired by Balatro
- Players combine random number generation and logic blocks to reach increasing goals
- Machine code-like execution but accessible to all audiences

### Key Issues Identified in Original Code
1. Execution Logic Problems
   - GOTO implementation doesn't handle bounds properly
   - IF statements skip incorrectly
   - LOOP logic is overly complex and buggy
   - Execution pointer manipulation is inconsistent

2. Game Balance Issues
   - Goals increase too slowlypredictably
   - Reward system lacks variety and excitement
   - Class differences are minimal
   - No compelling progression hooks

3. Missing Balatro-like Elements
   - Need more interesting block combinationssynergies
   - Lack of build-around strategies
   - Missing aha! moments when combinations work
   - No escalating complexitystakes

### Design Goals
- Make execution feel like machine code but understandable
- Create compelling block synergies like Balatro card combinations
- Increase difficulty curve and meaningful choices
- Fix all execution bugs for consistent gameplay

### Next Steps
1. Fix core execution engine
2. Improve block variety and synergies
3. Enhance progression system
4. Add more engaging reward mechanics

### Implementation Notes
- Using HTMLCSSJS with no external dependencies beyond CDN libraries
- State management through global gameState object
- UI updates through direct DOM manipulation
